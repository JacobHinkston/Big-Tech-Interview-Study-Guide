 * Interview Question 7.9: CircularArray.
 * Implement a Circular Array class that supports an array-like data structure which can be efficiently rotated. 
 * If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a template), and should support iteration via the standard for (Obj 0 : circularArray) notation.
